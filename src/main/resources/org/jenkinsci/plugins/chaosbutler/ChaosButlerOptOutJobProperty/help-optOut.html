<div>
    The Chaos Butler periodically wakes up and selects a build agent at random for disconnection.
    When this opt-out is selected, the Chaos Butler will ensure that the selected build agent is not running this job.
    In other words, enable the opt-out if you have a job that is critical and not resilient enough for use with the Chaos Butler.
